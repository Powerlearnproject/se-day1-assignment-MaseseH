# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering entails writing instructions called codes ,that enables a computer to build apps ,games and websites.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Machine code 
assembly language
Higher programing language
cloud computing

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning
Analysis
Designing
coding
Test and bug fixing
Deployment
Maintainance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall you follow a leaner flow of instructions,if you start from point A,You aim at finishing at point Z,without stopping.Example if you write a proposal to a donor and give adefinate budget,you won't go back to revise your budget.Its ideal in predictable,strict and high risk project.In agile i used in dynamic,flexible and user driven applications.You can change your instructions from time to time,example,you can change font size of a certain paper according to the likes of diffrent lecturers.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes codes,testing software application and software maintenance.Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality standards are met and development of software test cases.A project manager helps in project implementation over the project development cycle.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDESProvides code editing,de-burgging,code compilition and excecution.examples:Vs code,netbeans
VSC trucks and ensures that software is up to date and inline with its life cycle development.I.E GIT
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges 
1.Unclearly defined software development requirements for their users

1.The users should clearly define  the software requirements before the execution of the softwares.
2.keeping up with rapid technological changes.
3.Being actively involved in retrainer courses i.e code camps,tech webinars,hackatons and any other current  technological updates

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is done at the modular level of a software applicationIintergration testing is done after diffrent software modules have been merged together to form the entire application.(a single module)
system testing is performed at the point wereby the entire software system has been fully developed and ready for deployment.(whole set of modules).
Acceptance Its performed at the point of deployment with the inclusion on the user

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process  of providing inputs to AI models.
It provides optimization of Ai models response of its best model.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Is kenya a country or continent?
Tell me about kenyans independence and struggle towards independence

Effectiveness
The inclusion of'Tell me about kenyans independence and struggle towards independence'makes the prompt a clear,specific and concise.
